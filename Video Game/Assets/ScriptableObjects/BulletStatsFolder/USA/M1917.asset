  gunInfo: The M1917 Revolvers were six-shot, large frame revolvers adopted by the
    United States Military in 1917, to supplement the standard M1911 pistol during
    World War I. Many U.S. civilian arms companies including Colt and Remington were
    producing M1911 revolvers under contract for the U.S. Army, but even with the
    additional production there was a shortage of sidearms for the war.
