  gunInfo: The design of the Model 1903 (also known as the Browning No. 2) began
    in 1902 and entry into service was 1903. The Model 1903 was designed as a self-loading,
    semi-automatic pistol with a blowback. The gun was known for its speed in reloading
    action and was noted for its quickness and light weight. The Model 1903 unsurprisingly
    proved an accurate, reliable and robust weapon that helped during World War 1.
