  gunName: Mannlicher Model 1888
  gunInfo: "The Model 1888 had a straight-pull bolt-action design. It had a box magazine
    that was fed by five-round clips. The magazine was situated apart from the trigger
    group creating a small noticeable gap in between. The body was a single-piece
    wooden element that incorporated the shoulder stock, grip, receiver and long-running
    handguard in a traditional fashion. However, although new, its use was short-lived
    because of the French 8mm. It made all Austria-Hungary\u2019s rifle types obsolete.
    This Mannlicher design is noted as the first service rifle anywhere in the world
    to combine the benefits of a smokeless powder cartridge with the use of an integral
    box magazine.\r\n"
