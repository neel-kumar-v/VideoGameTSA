  gunInfo: "The Roth-Steyr M07 (or \"Model 07\") holds the distinction of becoming
    the first self-loading pistol to be accepted by a major world army anywhere on
    the globe. Its major operator became the Austro-Hungarian Army in World War 1.
    By modern standards the M07 took on a most utilitarian appearance, as it had
    a slim forward design with a bulky rear body. The pistol grip was thin with a
    diagonal grip pattern for optimal ergonomics. It was surprisingly light for having
    many capabilities, weighing in at 2 pounds when empty.\r"
