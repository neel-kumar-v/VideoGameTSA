  gunInfo: 'It was created by a Prussian-German gunsmith, Andreas Wilhelm Schwarzlose,
    and was the start of the water-cooled medium machine gun of the Austro-Hungarian
    Army in World War 1. Many European nations took this weapon as well and it was
    used till the end of World War 2. The Schwarzlose machine gun had a rectangular
    receiver, jacketed barrel section, and conical flash suppressor. It was a belt-fed
    weapon typically feeding from a 250-round ammunition stock. As a water-cooled
    weapon, the design required an accompanying water supply held in a can which
    was one of the main limitations of the gun. This was pumped into the water jacket
    by way of a hose and was used to cool the barrel from overheating.
