  gunName: Krnka M1867
  gunInfo: 'It was adopted by the Russian Empire in 1869 and was a breech loading
    gun. There were two versions of this gun, an infantry rifle and a cavalry rifle.
    However, shortly after its introduction to service, the M1867 was replaced by
    the Berdan rifle due to its better capabilities, but the M1867 did not die out
    and would still be used in Serbia. They were given out to Serbian conscripts
    and police forces. After being taken out of service, many Krnka rifles were converted
    into cheap smoothbore hunting shotguns.
