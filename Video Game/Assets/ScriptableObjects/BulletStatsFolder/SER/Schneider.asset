  gunInfo: "In 1897, the Serbian Army ordered six of these slow firing mortars, which
    arrived in the year 1900. These mortars were special because they were among
    the first Serbian weapons to be modernized to use smokeless powder, as these
    modifications happened in 1906-07. While in 1910, newer mortars were introduced,
    the Serbians still used these weapons in the \u201CHeavy Regiment of Fortress
    Artillery\u201D.\r\n"
