  gunInfo: The Nagant Model of 1895 was a seven-shot service revolver developed in
    Belgium and adopted by the Imperial Russian Army as its standard sidearm. The
    Brothers Nagant, Leon and Emile, had already lent their name to the famous Mosin-Nagant
    bolt-action service rifle, and now this revolver. The Tsarist Army moved to adopt
    a standard service revolver to further modernize its infantry forces and this
    became the Nagant Model of 1895 or simply the M1895 which went on to serve Russian
    forces well into the communist Soviet era. The revolver emerged from an 1894
    patent granted to Leon Nagant and was used in World War 1.
