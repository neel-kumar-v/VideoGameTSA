  gunInfo: Like all other world powers of the late-1800s, the Russian Empire sought
    modernization in its military inventory. This proved particularly important after
    the disastrous results of the Russian campaign against the Ottoman Empire in
    which a bulk of the Russian Army was equipped with the obsolete Berdan service
    rifles which the Russian Army sought to change. The Belgian brothers Emile and
    Leon Nagant decided to combine the best features of varying rifles to make a
    repeat-fire long gun capable of replacing the Berdans and arming Russian Army
    forces for the next several decades, including World War 1. Since its introduction
    occurred in 1891, the rifle was also called Model 1891 or M1891.
