  gunInfo: While bolt-action rifles were the call of the day at the turn of the century
    and leading into World War 1, Vladimir Fyodorov was one of many gunsmiths that
    looked to develop a select-fire weapon. He made the weapon and started working
    on the magazine for it. To minimize development delays on the magazine and increase
    the chances of the Russian Army, the Fedorov cartridge idea was dropped and the
    Japanese Arisaka cartridge. It held less power but was smaller, allowing a greater
    ammunition load, and putting less stress on the internal components particularly
    during automatic fire. The weapon was given the common name of Fedorov Avtomat
    and some were used during World War 1; however, many were not received due to
    the Russian Civil War.
