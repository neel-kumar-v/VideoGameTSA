  gunInfo: "The French war industry was forced to keep pace with the demand during
    World War 1. The French Army turned to a modernized version of the Model 1900
    machine gun, which introduced refined internals and lacked the safety system
    of the original, the Model 1914. They made a better stiff 24-round metal ammunition
    strip.  And developed three-round clips which could be linked together to form
    a full 249-round weapon. It was not as light as people hoped, but it still could
    be set up in a defensive manner. Over 47,000 Model 1914 units were delivered
    to the French Army during World War 1 up until the end of fighting in November
    of 1918.\r"
