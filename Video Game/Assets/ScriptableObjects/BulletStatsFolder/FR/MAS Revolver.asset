  gunInfo: "The MAS Modele 1892 revolver was selected by French military authorities
    to replace the aging MAS Modele 1873 revolver line. Roughly 337,000 examples
    were produced by Manufacture d-Armes de Saint-Etienne (MAS) and many went on
    to see service throughout World War 1 and even into World War 2. The Modele 1982
    made use of the smaller 8mm French Ordnance round which originally appeared in
    black-powder form before evolving to a smokeless powder design. The weapon could
    be fired through a Single-Action or Double-Action operation, the former requiring
    the user to work the hammer while the latter requiring just a complete trigger
    pull.\r"
