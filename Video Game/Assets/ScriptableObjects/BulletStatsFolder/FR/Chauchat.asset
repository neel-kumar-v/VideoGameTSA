  gunInfo: One of the most mocked guns in military history was the French "Chauchat"
    light machine gun, which was introduced in World War 1. Their original 8mm cartridges
    were well-regarded, useful battlefield weapons. American fighters who used the
    Chauchats found success with this weapon and several became decorated veterans
    of the war while engaging the enemy with their Chauchat Light Machine Guns.
