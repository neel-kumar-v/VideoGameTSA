  gunInfo: While mortars largely fell out of interest prior to World War 1, the stalemate
    of trench warfare forced national armies to revisit its battlefield value. Mortars
    had been in use for centuries prior and were "indirect fire" weapons capable
    of engaging enemy forces not only at distance but also without line of sight.
    They were generally large, heavy, and cumbersome. The British Stokes Mortar (3-inch)
    was one of the most famous of the early modern light mortars. It was drawn up
    by English engineer Sir Wilfred Stokes and greatly helped during World War 1.
