  gunInfo: The British Webley Bull Dog pocket revolver was a small, powerful firearm
    that saw considerable commercial success in a variety of forms. It was introduced
    in 1872 by Philip Webley and Son of Birmingham, England. It was popular and produced
    well into the 1900s and copied around the world. As a "pocket" revolver, the
    firearm was specifically designed to be small and compact, able to be concealed
    in the pocket of a user's coat and it was inexpensive.
