  gunInfo: Like most other medium support machine systems born around the turn of
    the century, the British Vickers Medium Machine Gun originated from the revolutionary
    Maxim series of 1889, ultimately, became a part of Vickers in 1897. The Maxim
    type saw widespread acceptance, adoption and copies by many world powers. The
    Vickers was essentially an improved Maxim. The Vickers also took to reducing
    the overall weight of the original product and introduced aluminum in concert
    with the required steel fabrication process. The result was one of the most successful
    battlefield machine guns ever developed and served with British forces from 1912
    to 1968.
